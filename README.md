## Overview
 
Imagine it: you've been working on your professional documents and profiles, searching for opportunities, and finally you've found one that you're enthusiastic about. Now, you need to actually apply to it.

This part is deceptively harder than it seems. Even though much of the work you've done applies for every application you put together, usually something about the work needs to be tailored for a specific audience: a position specific keyword needs to reiterated, certain experience should be more prominent -- there are a lot of small changes that can affect the perception of a reader. However, all readers have the same thing in common: they're an audience.

While the assignment varies based on the pathway you take, the ultimate goal is still to address an audience.

### Requirements

#### Professional opportunity

Using the resources for professional applications above:

- Choose an opportunity from a previous assignment or a new one that you've found since.
- Visit the application portal and look through the required fields for the application
  * Note all of the different fields and documents the application requires
  * Important: don't submit anything; you're merely gathering information
- In this single document, complete all of the parts of the application, which likely includes areas like:
  * A cover letter
  * A résumé
  * Application-specific questions

Keep in mind that the application may have organization-specific questions or other non-traditional items. These are significant as well; many things might not be captured by the above list.

* Include a copy of the listing you're creating application materials for at the top of the document
* Include a `PDF` of this document in the `writing` directory

#### Academic or other opportunity

Using the resources for statments above:

- Begin to draft your personal statement or statement of purpose
  * Keep in mind that you may have to maintain _both_ kinds of documents for different applications

* Include your personal statement or statement of purposes in the `writing` directory as a Markdown file

### Grading criteria

Like many assignments in this course, assessment of this work is based on completeness. I may indicate that you should revise this assignment which is an opporunity to receive full credit for the assignment should there be missing points or content.
